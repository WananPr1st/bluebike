If you suspect any unauthorized use of your Account, you agree to notify us immediately. You are solely responsible for any activities occurring under your Account. You have no ownership right to your Account.  If you are registering an Account on behalf of an organization under an agreement between us and another organization, that organization may have administrator rights to access your account and any information provided under your Account.

                            <p class="content">Some of the Services we offer include a bike rental program (the “Program”). In order to rent a bike using the Program, you will need to have a valid Payment Account on file with us, and when you sign up for an Account, we will authorize a deposit on the Payment Account in an amount shown on the Services (the “Deposit”). In addition to the Deposit, you will be charged for each rental at the rate shown on the Services. We will maintain your Payment Account on file until your Account is cancelled or terminated, at which time we will release the Deposit in accordance with these Terms.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content">If damage, theft, or loss to the bike occurs (or is deemed to have occurred) during the Responsibility Period, you authorize us to hold your Deposit until we can determine the amount of damage caused to the bike. If the combined amount of damage and loss of use (determined by us in our sole discretion) exceeds the amount of the Deposit, you acknowledge and agree that your entire Deposit will be forfeited and you further authorize us to charge your Payment Account for the remainder of the total cost to repair or replace any damaged, stolen, or lost equipment at retail replacement cost, plus loss of use.

                            <p class="content">Each time you rent a bike using the Program, our Rental Agreement and Waiver (the “Waiver”) will apply to that rental. The Waiver will always be available on the Services and is incorporated into this Agreement.

                            <p class="content">The Program is unique from other bike rental and bike sharing services in that it does not operate using racks at predefined locations. Instead, our bikes have a locking mechanism that allows you to end your rental anywhere, not just at a rack. You acknowledge and agree that upon ending a rental, you will park the rented bike in a public location where such parking is permitted by local laws and ordinances and further where the bike will not be subject to damage or destruction. You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for the rented bicycle from the time the bicycle is rented by you; until you finish your trip, lock your bicycle, and park it in a lawfully designated location; deemed appropriate by bluegogo International, Inc., and in accordance with the local laws and regulations.

                            <p class="content">You acknowledge and agree that you must ride with caution and comply with all traffic and other applicable laws, ordinances, and regulations (“Laws”) while using the Program. You are responsible for being informed as to all appropriate Laws. Please note that in most states, bikes follow the same rules, regulations, and responsibilities as automobiles. You agree not to use cameras, cell phones, or other electronic devices while riding.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content">When you rent a bike using the Program, you must check to ensure that the bike is in good condition prior to riding it. If you note damage or a maintenance issue during inspection, please report the issue to us using the mechanism provided on the Services. If you do not report any damage or maintenance issue to us prior to commencing your rental, you acknowledge and agree that the bike will be deemed to have no such issue at the time your rental began. You agree not to ride any bike that you note damage on.

                            <p class="content">Please read this section carefully. It contains procedures for mandatory binding arbitration and a class action waiver.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content">Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.  Before either we or you may seek arbitration, the party seeking arbitration must send the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and the requested relief.  A Notice to us should be sent to 4633 OLD IRONSIDES DR STE 106 SANTA CLARA, CA 95054. After the Notice is received, you and we may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If we do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content">Arbitration Rules.  Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (“ADR Provider”) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with the Terms.  The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“Arbitration Rules”) governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) shall be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in San Francisco, California, unless the parties agree otherwise. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content">Additional Rules for Non-Appearance Based Arbitration.  The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the parties.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content">Time Limits.  If either you or we pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
                            </p>
                            <p class="content">Authority of Arbitrator.  If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of the parties involved, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the Arbitration Rules, and these Terms.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.

                            </p>
                            <p class="content">Right to Waive.  Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Section 14may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other portion of this Section 14.

                    <p class="content">In order to improve our Products and the App and provide more convenient, relevant experiences to our customers, we and our agents may use “cookies,” “web beacons,” and similar devices to track your activities. A cookie is a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and can only be read by the server that gave it to you. It functions as your identification card and enables us to record your passwords and preferences. It cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses. A web beacon is a small transparent .gif image that is embedded in an HTML page or email used to track when the page or email has been viewed. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, and most services that include similar devices are typically initially activated to collect data. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. We do not support browsers’ Do Not Track features. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the preferences or settings page of your browser.
